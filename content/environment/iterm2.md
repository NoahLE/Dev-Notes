## Shells

* Check out [zsh](zsh.md), I love using this 

* [Hyper.io](https://hyper.is/) is another option that some people have recommended

## Theme

* [Powerline themes](https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes)

    * I recommend using the Solarized Light or Solarized Dark themes (installation instructions [are here](https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes#installation-instructions))

* You many need to install [powerline fonts](https://github.com/powerline/fonts) to get certain characters in themes to work
