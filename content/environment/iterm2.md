## Shells

* Check out the [zsh](zsh.md) page!

* [Hyper.io](https://hyper.is/) is another option that some people have recommended

## Themes

* [Powerline themes](https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes) - comes by default with iTerm2

    * I recommend using the Solarized Light or Solarized Dark themes (Go to > Preferences > Profiles > Colors > Color Presets > <THEME>)

* You many need to install [powerline fonts](https://github.com/powerline/fonts) to get certain characters in themes to work
