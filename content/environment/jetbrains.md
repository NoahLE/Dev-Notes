Jetbrains produces some incredible IDEs like Pycharm and Webstorm.

## Theming

1. To install the solarized light theme, go to [this repository](https://github.com/jkaving/intellij-colors-solarized) on Github and download the settings.jar file.

2. In your Jetbrains IDE of choice, go to `File -> Import Settings -> <FILE> -> Open`.

3. Active the theme by going to `Webstorm -> Preferences -> Editor -> Color Scheme -> General` and set the `Scheme` to your theme of choice.

## Caveats

- If you are a student or teacher, you may be eligable to get a free copy of their awesome software. See [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/student/) for more details.
