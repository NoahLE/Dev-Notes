## Estimating the cars value

Buying from a private seller will be cheaper with a higher risk. Buying from a dealship will hopefully involve less risk, but a higher price. I've heard to expect a $5-6000 premium is added to a cars value.

Here are some great sites to get a cars value:
- [Kelly Blue Book]()
- [NADA]()
- [True Car]()
- [Edmunds]()

An interesting strategy I've heard is getting the invoice price of a car and offering $500 more. Also, make sure you say you're going to finance the car, even if you play to buy it outright.

Accessories and extended warrenties are how the dealership makes money. It will provide peace of mind, but keep in mind the prices for each of these is negotiable.
