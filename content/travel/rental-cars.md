Everything useful for renting a car

## Discount codes

Check RetailMeNot, Coupons.com, and insurance providers for CDP codes to see if you can get a discount

Priceline offers a rental where they pick the company and give you a huge discount. I've had great luck with this but use at your own risk.

## Caveats

**WATCH FOR SURGE PRICING** - Do not rent on the same day. Ideally make your reservation at least 1-2 days before pickup.
