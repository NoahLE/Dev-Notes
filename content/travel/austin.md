## Apartment and house hunting

### Useful websites

- [r/Moving to Austin Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/Austin/wiki/movingtoaustin)
- [Austin Home Search](https://austinhomesearch.com/)
- [Apartments.com](https://apartments.com)
- [Craigslist](https://austin.craigslist.org/)

### Other tips

- Use an apartment hunter!
- Use a some kind of crime tracking map to get an idea of the neighborhood. [Spot Crime](https://spotcrime.com) is good.
- Ask if they have a 24/48 hour walk-in deal. Use these strategically since you have a very limited window to act.
- Double paned windows are huge for energy savings. Check the door weather stripping. Are the blinks good at blocking sunlight? What is the traffic like between 5-7pm?
