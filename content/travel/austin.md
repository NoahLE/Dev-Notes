### Other tips

- Use an apartment hunter!
- Gassons (tailor)
- Use a some kind of crime tracking map to get an idea of the neighborhood. [Spot Crime](https://spotcrime.com) is good.
- Ask if they have a 24/48 hour walk-in deal. Use these strategically since you have a very limited window to act.
- Double paned windows are huge for energy savings. Check the door weather stripping. Are the blinks good at blocking sunlight? What is the traffic like between 5-7pm?
