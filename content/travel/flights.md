## Tickets

Purchasing tickets is usually best on Wednesdays around 11AM. More info on this in [this article](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/finance/best-time-to-buy-plane-tickets/). Don't forget to check nearby airports and to buy your tickets at least three weeks in advance (if possible)!

## Websites

- [Expedia](https://expedia.com) or [Orbitz](https://orbitz.com) - Owned by the same company and nearly identical websites. Usually has the most flights, filtering is significantly worse than Google Flights and Kayak.
- [Google Flights](https://flights.google.com) - My #1 one choice for buying tickets
- [Kayak](https://kayak.com) - Great site for finding really good deals
- [Orbitz / Expedia]()
