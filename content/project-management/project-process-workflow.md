# Processes

1. Determine best project management method
    1. Agile
    2. Cleanroom
    3. Incremental
    4. Spiral
    5. Waterfall

# Requirements

1. Interview client about requirements
    1. What can their budget support?
    2. What are the timeline constraints?
    3. What are they expecting the software will accomplish?
    4. Who is the target audience?
    5. How will the product be deployed and used?

2. Define non-functional requirements:
    1. Business Rules
    2. Transaction corrections, adjustments and cancellations
    3. Administrative functions
    4. Authentication
    5. Authorization levels
    6. Audit Tracking
    7. External Interfaces
    8. Certification Requirements
    9. Reporting Requirements
    10. Historical Data
    11. Legal or Regulatory Requirements

3. Define functional requirements:
    1. Performance â€“ for example Response Time, Throughput, Utilization, Static Volumetric
    2. Scalability
    3. Capacity
    4. Availability
    5. Reliability
    6. Recoverability
    7. Maintainability
    8. Serviceability
    9. Security
    10. Regulatory
    11. Manageability
    12. Environmental
    13. Data Integrity
    14. Usability
    15. Interoperability

# Research

1. Market research and analysis
    1. Research current solutions in market, if any exist
    2. Libraries, software suites, PaaS / SaaS, subject matter experts most commonly used resources and tools, etc

# Outlining project

1. Create markets requirement document
2. Create project requirements document / functional specification document

# Defining purpose

1. Describing features
2. Setting release criteria
3. Sketching rough timing

# Design

1. Create proof of concept of product workflow
2. Organize information architecture
3. Create user behavior diagrams
4. Create use cases
5. Create personas
6. User audience, needs, goals
7. Create low fidelity mockups

# Visual design

1. Global navigations and information architecture
2. Functionality and usefulness
3. Create high fidelity mockups
4. Detailed interactions and UI design patterns
5. Content and terminology
6. Get client approval for the application

# Engineering

No changes by the client will be allowed past this point

1. Research language and frameworks to build the application while considering:
    1. Security
    2. Platform and browser compatibility
    3. Data structuring
    4. Usability
    5. Ease of development and flexibility
    6. Deployment and performance requirements
    7. Maintainability
    8. Create roadmap for project
    9. Break into task list and prioritize components for a minimum viable product

# Construction

Get final write-off, no design changes will be accepted past this point

1. Divide and conquer - break the segments of the project into as detailed items as possible
2. All requirements will be documented as a ticket or task
3. Any changes to tickets must be reviewed and approved by the development team and project manager
4. All features will be developed in independant branches
5. Every commit will increase code coverage
6. All submissions must pass continuous integration
7. All code must be kept in version control and uploaded to an off-site system
8. User and developer documentation should grow with the project and should cover the following items:
    1. Installation of the required dependencies as well as the languages and other technologies required to run the project
    2. Environment configuration
    3. Keys
    4. Environmental variables
    5. Server configuration
    6. Route configurations
    7. User workflow through the application
    8. Database mapping and relations
    9. In-code comments
    10. Testing / Debugging
9. Get product approval, no development aside from bug fixing and final release changes will be accepted past this point
10. Internal QA process
11. Max out code coverage
12. Deliver to client for initial audit
13. Deployment to staging servers
14. Deploy to live servers
15. Finalize documentation

# Delivery

1. Review project requirements / functional specification document
2. Shrinkwrap project
3. Deliver product to client

# Post-delivery

1. Maintenance
