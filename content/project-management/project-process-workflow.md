# Processes

1.  Determine best project management method
    1.  Agile
    2.  Cleanroom
    3.  Incremental
    4.  Spiral
    5.  Waterfall

# Requirements

1.  Interview client about requirements
    1.  What can their budget support?
    2.  What are the timeline constraints?
    3.  What are they expecting the software will accomplish?

## TODO finish formatting

Who is the target audience?
How will the product be deployed and used?
Define non-functional requirements:
Business Rules
Transaction corrections, adjustments and cancellations
Administrative functions
Authentication
Authorization levels
Audit Tracking
External Interfaces
Certification Requirements
Reporting Requirements
Historical Data
Legal or Regulatory Requirements
Define functional requirements:
Performance â€“ for example Response Time, Throughput, Utilization, Static Volumetric
Scalability
Capacity
Availability
Reliability
Recoverability
Maintainability
Serviceability
Security
Regulatory
Manageability
Environmental
Data Integrity
Usability
Interoperability
Market research and analysis
Research current solutions in market, if any exist
Libraries, software suites, PaaS / SaaS, subject matter experts most commonly used resources and tools, etc
Create markets requirement document
Create project requirements document / functional specification document
Defining purpose
Describing features
Setting release criteria
Sketching rough timing
Design
Create proof of concept of product workflow
Organize information architecture
Create user behavior diagrams
Create use cases
Create personas
User audience, needs, goals
Create low fidelity mockups
Visual design
Global navigations and information architecture
Functionality and usefulness
Create high fidelity mockups
Detailed interactions and UI design patterns
Content and terminology
Get client approval for the application
Engineering
No changes by the client will be allowed past this point
Research language and frameworks to build the application while considering:
Security
Platform and browser compatibility
Data structuring
Usability
Ease of development and flexibility
Deployment and performance requirements
Maintainability
Create roadmap for project
Break into task list and prioritize components for a minimum viable product
Construction
Get final write-off, no design changes will be accepted past this point
Divide and conquer - break the segments of the project into as detailed items as possible
All requirements will be documented as a ticket or task
Any changes to tickets must be reviewed and approved by the development team and project manager
All features will be developed in independant branches
Every commit will increase code coverage
All submissions must pass continuous integration
All code must be kept in version control and uploaded to an off-site system
User and developer documentation should grow with the project and should cover the following items:
Installation of the required dependencies as well as the languages and other technologies required to run the project
Environment configuration
Keys
Environmental variables
Server configuration
Route configurations
User workflow through the application
Database mapping and relations
In-code comments
Testing / Debugging
Get product approval, no development aside from bug fixing and final release changes will be accepted past this point
Internal QA process
Max out code coverage
Deliver to client for initial audit
Deployment
Deploy to live servers
Finalize documentation
Delivery
Review project requirements / functional specification document
Shrinkwrap project
Deliver product to client
Maintenance
Maintenance (Project specific)
