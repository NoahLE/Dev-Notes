Iron triange - scope, schedule, quality

We don't have the time, but have to make the time

Agile - good estimation, effective branching strategies for managing code, automated testing to protect quality, and continuous deployment to get fast feedback from users.

Estimate via time (x hours) or story points (0.5 - 20 points)

Time has emotional connection and can be iffy, story points are simply the amount of work and can be a collaborative process in deciding which points will be the most time consuming

If story points are taking too much time, they must be broken into smaller tasks

Estimate tasks in story points, track tasks in hours

Faster / shorter release cycles is ideal (keep deployed green)

## Scrum

Series of fixed length iterations (sprints)

Milestone - end of each sprint, proof of progress

Usually use task board and burnout chart for measuring

Three roles | description
--- | ---
Product owner | Build and manage the product backlog
Closely partner with the business and the team to ensure everyone understands the work items in the product backlog
Give the team clear guidance on which features to deliver next
Decide when to ship the product with the predisposition towards more frequent delivery 
Keep in mind that a product owner is not a project manager. Product owners are not managing the status of the program. They focus on ensuring the development team delivers the most value to the business. Also, it's important that the product owner be an individual. 

Scrum master | They coach the team, the product owner, and the business on the scrum process and look for ways to fine-tune their practice of it. An effective scrum master deeply understands the work being done by the team and can help the team optimize their delivery flow. As the facilitator-in-chief, they schedule the needed resources (both human and logistical) for sprint planning, stand-up, sprint review, and the sprint retrospective. Scrum masters also look to resolve impediments and distractions for the development team, insulating them from external disruptions whenever possible.
Scrum team | Strong scrum teams approach their project with a clear "we" attitude. All members of the team help one another to ensure a successful sprint completion.

Four milestones spring planning:
Ceremony | Description
--- | ---
Sprint planning | A team planning meeting that determines what to complete in the coming sprint.
Daily stand-up | Also known as a daily scrum, a 15-minute mini-meeting for the software team to sync. What did I complete yesterday? What will I work on today?    Am I blocked by anything?
Sprint demo | A sharing meeting where the team shows what they've shipped in that sprint.
Sprint retrospective | A review of what did and didn't go well with actions to make the next sprint better.



## The three ways of devops

Way | System name | Explanation
--- | --- | ---
The first way | System Thinking | emphasizes the performance of the entire system, as opposed to the performance of a specific silo of work or department â€” this can be as large a division or as small as an individual contributor.
The second way |	Amplify Feedback Loops 	| creating the right to left feedback loops. The goal of almost any process improvement initiative is to shorten and amplify feedback loops so necessary corrections can be continually made.
The third way 	| Culture of Continual Experimentation and Learning |	creating a culture that fosters two things: continual experimentation, taking risks and learning from failure; and understanding that repetition and practice is the prerequisite to mastery.
