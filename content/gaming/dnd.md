## Introduction

These are the steps needed to get up and running

## Prerequisites

- A [Twitch.tv](https://www.twitch.tv) account
- A [DnDBeyond](https://www.dndbeyond.com/) account (you need a Twitch.tv account to sign in)
- A [Roll20](https://roll20.net) account

## Character Creation

One thing worth mentioning before we start is that you can always go back and edit your character later.

1. After creating your Twitch account, log into the DnDBeyond website.
2. In the top left, mouse over the `Creations` link and select `My Characters`
3. In the top right, click the `Create a Character` button

I recommend using the `Standard` creation method with the `Help Text` box checked

### Character Preferences

This screen is for basic character configuration and item management.

1. Give your character a name (a first name is fine)
2. Advancement type is `Milestone`
3. Hit point type is `Fixed`
4. Use prerequisites should have both options enabled
5. Encumberance type is `No encumberance`
6. Ignore coin weight should be true
7. Ability Score/Modifier Display is your preference. I recommend `Modifiers Top`
8. Character Privacy should be `Public` so other people in the game can see what you chose

When you're done, click the blue `Next` button on the right side of the screen.

### Race

All races are about the same with some slight differences. You can select each race to see the benefits, their stats, backstory, and so on. 

You can see even more information by clicking the `_____ Details Page` link after selecting a race.

1. Filter the races by `Player's Handbook`
2. Select the race you'd like to play and click `Choose Race`

After you've selected a race you'll be taken to its detail's page. Review these items and click the blue `Next` button on the right side of the screen.

### Class

Classes define what kind of abilities and playstyle your character has. I highly recommend spending the time to reach through each class to see which one fits your playstyle.

- When choosing your class, take note of your `Primary Ability` and `Saves` abilities. You'll need these for a future configuration.
- If you wish to change your class, click the red X on the right side of the screen (next to your level dropdown)
- You can combine classes at higher levels for even more fun!

When you've selected your class, click the blue `Next` button.

- On the next screen, choose your proficencies. I recommend prioritizing abilities that will benefit your class. For example, casters usually benefit from `Arcana` and rogues benefit from `Deception`.
- Select any other class features that are required

At the top of the screen, select the `Spells` link (it's right below your class icon).

- Expand the `Add Spells` section and look at how many `Cantrips` and `Spells` you can choose.
- Pick at least two `Spells` that will help you during combat

When you've selected your character flavors, click the blue `Next` button.

### Abilities

This is where you'll be setting up your character's stats.

I recommend using the `Standard Array` configuration, but more advanced players might prefer to use one of the other methods.

- When you chose your class, choose the highest stats for the abilities mentioned when you were choosing your class
- For the remaining points, choose stats that seem the most interesting

When you've selected your abilites, click the blue `Next` button.

### Description

This section is completely optional. I personally recommend at least looking at the sections to see what kinds of options are available for describing your character.

**Please don't choose any vein of evil character**

When you're done, click the blue `Next` button

### Equipment

1. Skip the `Attuned Magic Items` section
2. Under `Starting Equipment` select `Equipment`
3. Choose the armor type, weapon type, and pack (these might slightly vary based on your class)
   1. You can use [DnDBeyond's](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment) equipment search to learn about what is in each of the packs
4. Skip the `Add Items` section (for now)

When you're done, click the blue `Next` button.

**You have now finished your character creation!**
