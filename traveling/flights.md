# Flights

## Tickets

Purchasing tickets is usually best on a Wednesday around 11AM. More info on this in [this article]().

## Websites

- [Expedia](https://expedia.com) or [Orbitz](https://orbitz.com) - Owned by the same company and nearly identical websites. Usually has the most flights, filtering is significantly worse than Google Flights and Kayak.
- [Google Flights](https://flights.google.com) - My #1 one choice for buying tickets
- [Kayak](https://kayak.com) - Great site for finding really good deals
